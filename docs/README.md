## Quick Start

1. Understanding the System: Start with `project-overview.md`
2. Database Operations: Reference `database-schema.md` and `api-documentation.md`
3. Frontend Development: Use `component-architecture.md` and `ui-ux-improvements.md`
4. Security & Performance: Review `security-analysis.md` and `performance-optimization.md`
5. Deployment: Follow `deployment-guide.md` and `development-guidelines.md`

## System Status

- Version: 1.0.1
- Status: Active development
- Last Updated: 2025-09-15
- Technology Stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Tailwind CSS

## Critical Development Rules

- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER use Decimal type with SQLite ‚Äî use Float instead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER bypass NextAuth.js authentication
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS check existing components before creating new ones
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MAINTAIN backward compatibility with existing features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è USE existing API routes and component patterns

For detailed development rules, see [`development-guidelines.md`](./development-guidelines.md).
