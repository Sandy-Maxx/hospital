# SuperAdmin Setup and Usage Guide

## Overview
The SuperAdmin system has been successfully implemented with the following features:
- SUPERADMIN role with highest privileges
- Secure role-based access control
- Edition management system
- Development login helpers

## SuperAdmin User Created
A SuperAdmin user has been created with the following credentials:
- **Email**: `superadmin@hospital.com`
- **Password**: `superadmin123`
- **Role**: `SUPERADMIN`

## Access Control Rules

### Role Hierarchy
1. **SUPERADMIN** - Highest level access
   - Can create/manage all user types including ADMIN
   - Can access SuperAdmin panel for edition management
   - Can bypass certain restrictions (e.g., inactive account login)

2. **ADMIN** - Administrative access
   - Can create DOCTOR, NURSE, RECEPTIONIST users
   - **CANNOT** create SUPERADMIN users
   - Can access admin panels and user management

3. **DOCTOR, NURSE, RECEPTIONIST** - Standard roles
   - Limited to their respective functional areas

### Security Implementation
- API endpoints validate user roles before allowing operations
- User creation API prevents admins from creating superadmins
- UI elements are conditionally rendered based on user role
- Authentication system allows emergency superadmin access

## SuperAdmin Panel Features

### Edition Management
- Switch between BASIC, ADVANCED, and ENTERPRISE editions
- Real-time feature toggling based on selected edition

- `scripts/add-superadmin-user.js` - Script to create superadmin
- `scripts/verify-superadmin.js` - Verification script

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
1. Use the development login page at `/dev-login`
2. Click "SuperAdmin" quick login button
3. Navigate to `/superadmin` to access the panel

### For Production
1. Login with superadmin credentials
2. Access the superadmin panel through navigation

## Security Notes
- SuperAdmin credentials should be changed in production
- The development login page should be disabled in production
- Edition changes are logged for audit purposes
- Role-based access is enforced at both API and UI levels

## Testing the Implementation
1. Login as SuperAdmin
2. Navigate to `/superadmin`
3. Test edition switching
