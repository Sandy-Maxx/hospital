## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Consistent Pattern Applied:
```typescript
// At the top of each component
import { hasFeature } from "@/lib/edition";

// In the component function
if (!hasFeature("feature_name")) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="pt-6">
        <p className="text-center text-red-600">
          Access denied. [Feature] is not available in your current edition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center text-gray-500 mt-2">
          Please upgrade to ADVANCED or ENTERPRISE edition to access [Feature] features.
        </p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Error Handling:
- All feature checks have try-catch blocks
- On error, basic features are included to prevent UI breakage
- Advanced features are excluded on error for security

## 🎯 **Testing Results**

### BASIC Edition Test:
1. **Force Sync** to BASIC edition using debug component
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Shows only 4 cards (Settings, Staff, Reports, Patients)
3. **Settings Hub**: Shows only 3 cards (Hospital Settings, Problem Categories, Departments)
4. **Direct Access**: Visiting `/ipd`, `/lab`, `/imaging`, `/ot`, `/pharmacy-queue` shows access denied
5. **Sidebar**: Shows only basic navigation items

### ENTERPRISE Edition Test:
1. **Force Sync** to ENTERPRISE edition
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Shows all 9 cards including advanced features
3. **Settings Hub**: Shows all 5 cards including IPD and OT settings
4. **Direct Access**: All advanced pages work normally
5. **Sidebar**: Shows all navigation items

## ✅ **Current Status**
