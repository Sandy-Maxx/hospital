## Current Implementation Status ✅

### Files Updated:
1. **`app/(authenticated)/admin/page.tsx`** - Admin dashboard cards now filter by edition
2. **`app/(authenticated)/admin/settings/page.tsx`** - Settings hub cards now filter by edition
3. **`components/layout/sidebar.tsx`** - Already filters menu items by edition
4. **`lib/edition.ts`** - Enhanced with proper feature checking

### How It Works:
- Each admin card has a `feature` property
- `hasFeature()` function checks if feature is available in current edition
- Cards are filtered before rendering
- Error handling ensures basic features always show

1. Set edition to BASIC in SuperAdmin panel

3. **Admin Dashboard should show**: 4 cards (Settings, Staff, Reports, Patients)
